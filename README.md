# filecopier
FileCopier is a platform-independent utility for copying multiple files and folders to multiple locations with a single click.

FileCopier allows users to copy multiple files and folders to multiple directories by use of scripts. A from script contains the full paths to all files/directories you wish to copy. A to script contains all the directories to which you wish to copy the files/directories in the from script.

If a file/directory exists, you have the option to overwrite, rename, or skip. If you choose to rename, you have the option to create a restore script. A restore script allows you to "undo" a copy operation later. Restore scripts can only be built if you choose to rename existing files.

FileCopier requires java version 1.6 (or later).
